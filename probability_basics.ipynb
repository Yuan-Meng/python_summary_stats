    "    \n",
    "   Because the coin is balanced and each flip is independent, the probability of getting each of the three patterns is the same: $\\frac{1}{2}^4 = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n",

Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "   The sample is not representative of all users on the company website. While users who are asked to fill out the survey are randomly selected, I feel that most of them won't actually complete it. Those who chose to fill out the survey may differ from a typical user in some aspects. For instance, they may enjoy the company website more than most or they may have usunally more spare time than other people. Because of the potential selection bias, the estimation may not be accurate."

There are two situations where a person would get a positive test result: A sufferer getting correctly diagnosed and a non-sufferer getting a false positive. So the correct answer is $P(\\mathrm{positive}) = P(\\mathrm{positive|sufferer})\\times P(\\mathrm{sufferer}) + P(\\mathrm{positive|non{\\text -}sufferer})\\times P(\\mathrm{non{\\text -}sufferer}) = 98\\% \\times 0.5\\% + 10\\% \\times (1-0.5\\%) = 10.44\\%.$\n",
